# Google Search FrontEnd Project 

This project is a simple search engine simulation project that includes three webpages: Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. Each webpage mimics the Google search engine interface to provide users with a familiar search experience.

## Pages

### Google Search

The Google Search page features a search bar where users can enter their search queries. Upon submitting a query, users are redirected to the Google search results page with the relevant search results.

### Google Image Search

The Google Image Search page allows users to search for images. Users can enter their search queries in the search bar and view image search results.

### Google Advanced Search

The Google Advanced Search page provides users with advanced search options to refine their search queries. Users can search for specific words, exact phrases, or exclude certain words from their search results.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: For structuring the webpages
- CSS: For styling the webpages
- Bootstrap: For responsive design and styling
- Font Awesome: For icons used in the project
